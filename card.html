			<p class="description">Platypus, also called duckbill, a small amphibious Australian mammal noted for its odd combination of primitive features and special adaptations, especially the flat, almost comical bill that early observers thought was that of a duck sewn onto the body of a mammal. The platypus is common in waterways of eastern Australia, where it generally feeds on bottom-dwelling invertebrates but also takes an occasional frog, fish, or insect at the water’s surface. Despite being a mammal, the platypus lays eggs. <i>Source: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/platypus">Encyclopædia Britannica</a></i></p>
